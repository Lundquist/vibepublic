* This repo is a clone of an existing project, all data is collected from a test company for that project. 
* When you want to test it, add "/?companyId=1" after localhost:xxxx
* The app is in spanish, but if you want to change language you can do it by editing fallbackLng in "src\i18n.js" to one of {es, en, sv}, however not all parts have translations so there might be some missing key/value pairs, or some strings might be in pure text and not i18n compatible.
